Summary & Description:

    Implemented 4 data modules: 


        - Linear Regression w/ Count Vectorizer

        - Linear Regression w/ TFIDF Vectorizer

        - Multinomial Naive Bayesian w/ Count Vectorizer

        - Multinomial Naive Bayesian w/ TFIDF Vectorizer


    Description:


        Cybersecurity has been a great issue worldwide. Through this project, we hope to gain

        insights of how important cybersecurity is and get hands on experience into machine 
        
        learning  technologies to also create a URL scanner for malicious urls to prevent 
        
        exploitation and hacking.
